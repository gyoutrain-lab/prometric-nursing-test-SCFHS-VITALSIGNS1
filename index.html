/* ========= SAMPLE FORMAT (REPEATED TO 100) ========= */
{
q: "A patient’s blood pressure drops from 118/76 to 88/54 with HR 126. What is the priority nursing action?",
options: [
"Recheck blood pressure in 15 minutes",
"Document findings",
"Initiate circulatory support and notify physician",
"Administer prescribed pain medication"
],
answer: 2,
rationale: "SBP <90 with tachycardia indicates shock. SCFHS prioritizes immediate circulation support and escalation. Monitoring or documentation delays life-saving care."
},
{
q: "A postoperative patient reports pain 9/10. Vital signs show BP 86/50 and HR 118. What should the nurse do FIRST?",
options: [
"Administer opioid analgesic",
"Assess incision site",
"Address hypotension and notify physician",
"Reassure patient"
],
answer: 2,
rationale: "Pain treatment is delayed when circulation is unstable. Hypotension is life-threatening and must be corrected first."
},
{
q: "An elderly patient becomes suddenly confused. Oxygen saturation is 88%. What is the priority action?",
options: [
"Reorient the patient",
"Apply oxygen and assess airway",
"Document mental status",
"Ask family about baseline"
],
answer: 1,
rationale: "Acute confusion + hypoxia indicates cerebral oxygen deprivation. Oxygenation is the priority in SCFHS exams."
},
{
q: "Urine output drops to 15 mL/hr for two consecutive hours. BP is 92/60. What does this indicate?",
options: [
"Normal postoperative change",
"Renal disease",
"Poor perfusion requiring intervention",
"Need for fluid restriction"
],
answer: 2,
rationale: "Low urine output reflects inadequate renal perfusion. SCFHS treats this as circulatory failure until corrected."
},
{
q: "A patient with fever 39°C, HR 110, RR 24, and altered mental status is admitted. Priority action?",
options: [
"Administer antipyretic",
"Start isolation and notify physician",
"Encourage oral fluids",
"Document findings"
],
answer: 1,
rationale: "Vital-sign abnormalities + mental change suggest sepsis. Immediate escalation and infection control are required."
},
{
  id: 7,
  level: "EASY",
  question: "A 68-year-old male with pneumonia is receiving oxygen at 2 L/min via nasal cannula. Vital signs: RR 32/min, SpO₂ 89%, HR 118 bpm, BP 132/78 mmHg. The patient is restless and using accessory muscles. What is the nurse’s PRIORITY action?",
  options: [
    "Increase oxygen flow rate",
    "Notify the physician",
    "Encourage coughing and deep breathing",
    "Document findings and reassess later"
  ],
  correct: 0,
  rationale: "Abnormal RR, low SpO₂, and respiratory distress indicate immediate airway/breathing compromise. SCFHS tie-breaker prioritizes correcting oxygenation before notification or documentation."
},
{
  id: 8,
  level: "EASY",
  question: "A postoperative patient reports dizziness when standing. Vital signs show BP 88/56 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 18/min, SpO₂ 96%. What is the MOST appropriate initial nursing action?",
  options: [
    "Assist the patient back to bed",
    "Notify the surgeon",
    "Administer IV fluids",
    "Document orthostatic hypotension"
  ],
  correct: 0,
  rationale: "Hypotension with symptoms indicates compromised circulation. Immediate safety intervention takes priority before escalation or treatment."
},

{
  id: 9,
  level: "EASY",
  question: "A patient receiving IV opioids has RR 10/min, SpO₂ 91%, HR 72 bpm, BP 128/76 mmHg. The patient is difficult to arouse. What should the nurse do FIRST?",
  options: [
    "Stimulate the patient and assess airway",
    "Administer naloxone",
    "Notify the physician",
    "Document findings"
  ],
  correct: 0,
  rationale: "SCFHS prioritizes airway and breathing assessment before antidote administration unless respiratory arrest is present."
},

{
  id: 10,
  level: "EASY",
  question: "A client with sepsis has a temperature of 39.4°C, HR 122 bpm, RR 28/min, BP 90/54 mmHg. Which finding MOST indicates a life-threatening condition?",
  options: [
    "Fever",
    "Tachycardia",
    "Hypotension",
    "Tachypnea"
  ],
  correct: 2,
  rationale: "Hypotension reflects failing circulation and impending shock, which is a key SCFHS safety tie-breaker."
},

{
  id: 11,
  level: "MEDIUM",
  question: "A 72-year-old client with heart failure gains 2 kg in 24 hours. Vital signs: BP 146/88 mmHg, HR 92 bpm, RR 22/min, SpO₂ 94%. What is the nurse’s BEST initial action?",
  options: [
    "Assess lung sounds and edema",
    "Notify the provider immediately",
    "Restrict fluids",
    "Administer diuretics"

  question: "A diabetic patient is confused and diaphoretic. Vital signs: HR 108 bpm, BP 134/82 mmHg, RR 20/min, SpO₂ 97%. What should the nurse do FIRST?",
  options: [
    "Check blood glucose level",
    "Administer insulin",
    "Call the physician",

  rationale: "Altered mental status with sympathetic signs suggests hypoglycemia. Assessment precedes treatment."
},

{
  id: 13,
  level: "MEDIUM",
  question: "A postoperative patient has a pain score of 8/10. Vital signs: BP 168/96 mmHg, HR 104 bpm, RR 22/min. What explains these vital-sign changes?",
  options: [
    "Pain-induced sympathetic response",
    "Fluid overload",
    "Infection",
    "Medication reaction"
  ],
  correct: 0,
  rationale: "SCFHS often tests interpretation of vital signs. Pain causes transient hypertension and tachycardia."
},

    "Apply low-flow oxygen",
    "Prepare for intubation",
    "Document baseline status",
    "Encourage oral fluids"
  ],

    "Stop the transfusion",
    "Notify the physician",
    "Administer antipyretics",
    "Document the reaction"
  ],
  correct: 0,

    "Provide comfort-focused care",
    "Initiate CPR",
    "Call a code blue",
    "Administer vasopressors"
  ],

    "Initiate sepsis protocol",
    "Administer antipyretics immediately",
    "Notify the surgeon urgently"
